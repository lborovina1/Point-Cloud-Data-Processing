# Point Cloud Data Processing project

## Overview
This repository is part of a project for Digital Signal Processing course at the **Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Sarajevo**. It is dedicated to the processing and analysis of point cloud data, typically generated by 3D scanning or LiDAR technology. The project includes a set of tools and scripts to manipulate, clean, and analyze point cloud datasets, enabling efficient extraction of meaningful information for applications in object detection and spatial analysis.

## Implemented Algorithms
The following algorithms have been implemented and analyzed within the project:

- **Compression using Voxel Grid**
- **Statistical Outlier Removal**
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Mean Shift Clustering**
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
- **RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus)**

## Features
- Data cleaning and noise reduction
- Segmentation of point cloud data
- Visualization tools for analyzing point cloud datasets
